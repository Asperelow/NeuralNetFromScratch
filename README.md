# NeuralNetFromScratch
A simple and convolutional neural network from scratch in python. 

### Basic_NN_Momentum
A simple neural network, made to do something useful unlike some other practice Neural Networks out there. Upon starting up, this program will take in the user adjustable parameters to train a simple neural network to differentiate between positvie and negative numbers. 

### Conv_NN
A convolutional Neural network that has yet to be finished. Upon completion, it should be trained on the mnist dataset to differentiate between numbers. Due to the long run time of this program, it has been difficult to pin down the problem (it takes several hours to complete).
